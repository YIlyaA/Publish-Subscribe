# Publish-Subscribe
Publish-Subscribe limited message distribution system up to N capacity.


**Files:**
- `main.c` - test file
- `publish.c` - function implementation
- `publish.h` - declared functions

- The structure will be bombarded with queries, it should not crash and work optimally in terms of memory.
- It must implement the interface specified by sobanca.
- AddMsg blocking if there is no space, similarly to GetMsg.

**Report:**
- In the report, describe important information about data structures, especially for the 2nd project
- the sooner I send it, the better feedback I will get *(if I send it too late, only information about the error, if sooner, then guidance)*
- everyone should have grades by the last class
- during the classes in January, half of the class will receive tips from Sobaniec, the other half will have time for discussions and questions
- there will be verification of the authorship of the project, so you need to know what a given thing does
- The scale of points for the final grade is a total of 40 points to obtain, 20 for the test, max 20 for the project
- Sobaniec will provide the final scale later, definitely from 20 a pass, but the threshold may be lowered
